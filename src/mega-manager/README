Mega-Manager
============

This utility Django app provides a function, `make_manager` that can be used
to combine several managers together into a hybrid manager class. This hybrid
manager will have all the methods defined in each manager that helps compose
it.

Additionally, manager classes provided to `make_manager` can define a
`query_set_class` attribute, which should contain a class that is a sub-class
of QuerySet. The query set class used by the hybrid manager will itself be a
hybrid of all the custom query set classes defined in the original managers.
This means that if multiple managers provide custom query set classes that
have custom methods,

For a usage example, see the code in `tests`.
